Online Student Management System

 1. Introduction

  1.1 Purpose
The Online Student Management System aims to simplify the management of student records for educational institutions. It provides functionalities for adding, viewing, updating, and managing student information efficiently in a centralized platform.

  1.2 Scope
This system is designed for small to medium-sized institutions to maintain and manage student details. The system will allow administrators to add, update, and view student records through a user-friendly interface while maintaining data integrity.

  1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- JSP: JavaServer Pages
- JDBC: Java Database Connectivity
- CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- UI: User Interface

  1.4 References
- MySQL Documentation
- Java SE Development Kit Documentation
- Apache Tomcat Documentation

 2. Overall Description

  2.1 Product Perspective
The system will replace manual processes and spreadsheets by providing a digital solution. It will be accessible via web browsers and require minimal training for users.

  2.2 Product Features
- Add new student records with fields like name, age, major, and year.
- View all student records in a tabular format with options to edit or delete entries.
- Update or delete existing student records with confirmation dialogs.
- Maintain data consistency and prevent duplicate entries.

  2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- Administrators: Responsible for managing student records.
- Students: May access their own records (future enhancement).

  2.4 Operating Environment
- Server: Apache Tomcat 9.0 or later
- Database: MySQL 5.7 or later
- Client: Modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

  2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users have basic knowledge of web applications.
- Database server and application server are set up and running.

 3. Functional Requirements

  3.1 Add Student Record
- Input: Name, Age, Major, Year
- Process: Validate and insert data into the database.
- Output: Confirmation of record addition.

  3.2 View All Students
- Input: None
- Process: Retrieve all student records from the database.
- Output: Display records in a table with edit and delete options.

  3.3 Update Student Record
- Input: Student ID, Updated Fields
- Process: Validate and update the record in the database via an edit.jsp page.
- Output: Confirmation of record update.

  3.4 Delete Student Record
- Input: Student ID
- Process: Remove the record from the database with user confirmation via a delete.jsp page.
- Output: Confirmation of record deletion.

 4. Non-Functional Requirements

  4.1 Performance Requirements
- The system should handle up to 100 concurrent users.
- Operations (add/view/update/delete) should execute within 2 seconds.

  4.2 Security Requirements
- User credentials and sensitive data should be securely stored.
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection and other vulnerabilities.

  4.3 Usability Requirements
- Intuitive and straightforward user interface.
- Provide error messages for invalid inputs.

 5. System Design Constraints
- The system must use Java and JSP for backend processing.
- MySQL must be the database for data storage.

 6. Testing

  6.1 Testing Overview
The project was rigorously tested to ensure functionality, performance, and security. The following tests were conducted:

- Unit Testing: Each module, including add, view, update, and delete functionalities, was tested independently to ensure correctness.
- Integration Testing: Verified the seamless interaction between JSP pages, the backend database, and the application server.
- Functional Testing: Ensured all CRUD operations work as expected.
- Performance Testing: Tested system responsiveness with multiple concurrent users and ensured operations completed within acceptable timeframes.
- User Acceptance Testing: Simulated real-world usage scenarios to validate usability and user-friendliness.
- Security Testing: Checked input validation to prevent SQL injection and unauthorized access.

  6.2 Testing Tools
- Manual testing was performed for functional validation.
- Database operations were validated using MySQL Workbench.
- Browser Developer Tools were used to debug and test the UI.

  6.3 Testing Results
- All modules passed the defined test cases.
- The system maintained data integrity under various scenarios.
- No major performance or security issues were identified.

 7. Future Enhancements
- Add student search functionality.
- Enable role-based access (e.g., students accessing their records).
- Integrate a reporting module to generate student analytics.
